# Invasion : small JS game

## Requirements
You need [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/).
Oh and a [browser](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/new/).
That's it.

## What does it look like ?

You can see it live [here](https://xuloh.github.io/invasion)

## How to run/build/whatever

Once the repo is cloned, cd into the directory and run
`npm install` to install the dependencies.

Then you can run
- `npm run watch` to start the dev server and go to [http://localhost:12345](http://localhost:12345)
- `npm run build` to build the app, you can then find it in the `dist` sub directory

Enjoy :D
